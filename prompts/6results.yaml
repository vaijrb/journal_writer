# Purpose: Present findings clearly, with appropriate statistics and without interpretation beyond what data show.

Data summary/statistics: {key_results_summary}  # e.g., "Remote work positively associated with productivity (β=0.23, p<.01); interaction with isolation significant (β=-0.15, p=.02)"
Tables/figures to mention: {list_of_tables_figures}  # e.g., "Table 1: Descriptive stats; Table 2: Regression results"

# Instructions:
# Write the Results section. Report:
# - Descriptive statistics briefly
# - Main model outcomes with effect sizes, confidence intervals, p-values
# - Interaction/moderation or mediation results if applicable
# - Any robustness/sensitivity analyses
# 
# Use appropriate statistical notation and include in-text references to tables and figures (e.g., "As shown in Table 2..."). Do not interpret results; stick to what was observed. Use past tense. Provide brief sentence summarizing key findings at end.
